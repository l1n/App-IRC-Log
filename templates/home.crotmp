  <h1>Welcome to the home of the Raku Programming Language IRC logs</h1>
  <p>
This website provides access to the historic IRC logs of the development of
the <a href="https://raku.org">Raku Programming Language</a>.  They are
provided here as well as possible, but there is no guarantee that these logs
are by any means complete: network issues can cause an IRC logger to lose
connection with the IRC server, while people are still chatting on a channel.
Thus losing parts of the conversation, at least as seen by some people on a
channel.
